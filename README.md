# What Drives Me?
I'm not driven by a desire to become super rich or to "revolutionize" whatever industry. I just like cool problems! When I'm up at 3am deliriously working on a math problem and I suddenly discover some key insight to the proof, I get all giddy with excitement. It's the same feeling I feel when I figure out just the right way to poke a watch movement with a toothpick to get it to run a few seconds more accurately. All the things I've ever been interested in—playing with Legos, modifying Nerf blasters, coding, math, fountain pens, watches—they've all centered around creative, playful problem solving. That's what drives me.

Are you working on any cool problems? Maybe we can work on them together.
