\resumesection{Projects}

\textbf{Thue-Morse Connect Four}, \href{https://github.com/code-by-matt/tmc4node}{github.com/code-by-matt/tmc4node}  \hfill October 2018--Present
\begin{itemize}
	\item Built a variant of Connect Four to explore what happens when players take turns following the Thue-Morse sequence. Intended to eliminate the game's first-player advantage. See it at code-by-matt.github.io/connect4.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Seam Carving}, class project \hfill April 2019
\begin{itemize}
	\item Implemented an image resizing algorithm in Java that preserves an image's content without cropping or stretching.
	\item Achieved by using Dijkstra's algorithm to find minimal-energy seams in an image.
\end{itemize}
